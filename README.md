## Project Title
Gap Reminder Project

## Purpose, goals, questions to answer
The current project is aimed at investigating basic demographics of different countries over time. 
The project is aimed at finding the answer to the following question: Is there any association between country/region and life expectancy/income (and if not all, any)?

## Data description
The current project uses a dataset downloaded from the Moodle course website. 
The dataset contains categorical variables including Country and Region, interval variable including Year, and ratio variables including Life, Population and Income.
The investigation will include data preparation (data cleaning and transformation), analysis (basic statistics and cluster analysis) and evaluation.

## Data preparation, analysis and evaluation

As seen from the qplots, life expectancy/income both increase over time.

However, regardless of year, there are differences among regions in terms of life expectancy/income (i.e., there is an association between region and life expectancy/income). Europe & Central Asia and America are the richest, have the least income disparity and highest life expectancy. Sub-Saharan Africa is the poorest and has the lowest life expectancy. Middle East & North Africa and East Asia & Pacific are the most inequal income-wise. The similarity between the region and income relationship and the region and life expectancy relationship supports a covariance between income and life expectancy, also supported by correlation matrix visualizations. 

The project is powerful as it used different methods of analysis and visualization techniques. Further research can be done on how life expectancy/income change year over year, specifically how the difference among regions change over year in terms of life expectancy/income.
